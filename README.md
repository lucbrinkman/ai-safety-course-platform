# AI Safety Education Platform Bot

A Discord bot for automating all the logistics of AI Safety Courses.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd bot
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Make sure you have a `.env` file with your `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`.

## Hosting

Two Railway services:
- **Bot**: Python Discord bot (`bot/`)
- **Activities**: Static file server (`activities/`) - each subfolder is a route

## How to Add Features

### Adding a new command
1. Open the relevant cog in `bot/cogs/` (or create a new one)
2. Add your command:
   ```python
   @app_commands.command(name="mycommand", description="Does cool stuff")
   async def my_command(self, interaction: discord.Interaction):
       await interaction.response.send_message("Hello!")
   ```
3. Restart the bot - commands sync automatically

### Creating a new cog
1. Create `bot/cogs/my_feature.py`
2. Copy the structure from an existing cog
3. Add it to `COGS` list in `main.py`
4. Restart the bot

### Making something admin-only
Add this decorator above your command:
```python
@app_commands.checks.has_permissions(administrator=True)
```

### Modifying cohort names
Edit `bot/utils/cohort_names.py` - change the `COHORT_NAMES` list to whatever you want.

## Key Commands

**Students:**
- `/signup` - Sign up or edit signup (course, timezone, availability)
- `/list-courses` - See available courses
- `/my-progress` - View course progress

**Admins:**
- `/add-course` - Create a new course
- `/add-week` - Add a week to a course
- `/cohort` - Manually create a cohort from selected members
- `/schedule` - Run automatic cohort scheduling algorithm

## How It Works

1. **Admins** create courses with `/add-course` and add weeks with `/add-week`
2. **Students** sign up with `/signup`, select courses and availability
3. **Admins** either:
   - Use `/schedule` to auto-generate cohorts based on availability
   - Use `/cohort` to manually create cohorts
4. **Cohorts** get private channels and scheduled weekly meetings (one per course week)
5. **Students** complete weeks by reacting ✅, which unlocks the next week
